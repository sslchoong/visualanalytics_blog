However, the use of sorting for the chart “% of strongly agreed to vaccination” makes it easier for readers to view the relative results across the countries.\r\nAlign the country order such that the values for each country are shown on the same row. Countries can be sorted in decreasing % of respondents who selected strongly agreed\r\n2\r\nThe charts are showing the % of survey respondents who selected the respective response values. As the survey only polled a subset of the citizens within each country (i.e. sample) instead of all citizens (i.e. population), there would be some form of uncertainty associated with the values shown. However, the existing chart does not depict any uncertainty and readers might interpret the chart as showing the precise representation of the country’s true acceptance towards the vaccine.\r\nExplore using statistical values to reflect the uncertainty associated with the survey results\r\n3\r\nThe current chart title does not clearly describe the question being asked to capture the findings shown, which is only covering willingness to get the vaccine if available this week. Research also mainly utilised the survey data from interviews conducted in January 2021, but this timeframe was not shown in the data visualisation.\r\nRevise the chart title to better represent the question asked as well as to reflect the timeframe of January 2021 within the data visualisation\r\n4\r\nValue labels for the left chart were kept to the original data labels which only indicated the textual label for rating 1 and rating 5 and keeping ratings 2 to 4 as the numeric label only. This might not be intuitive to the readers on what each number represents.\r\nRecode the values to use textual labels instead (i.e. 1 as “Strongly agree”, 2 as “Agree”, 3 as “Neutral”, 4 as “Disagree” and 5 as “Strongly disagree”)\r\n5\r\nScale of the x-axis of the two charts are not synchronised, causing the bars of the right chart to appear longer than the same value on the left chart. This might be misleading to the readers.\r\nSynchronise the axis for all charts, particularly those that are side by side so that the scales of the charts are aligned\r\nAesthetics\r\nS/N\r\nComments\r\nSuggested Improvement\r\n6\r\nCurrent position of the legend makes it difficult for the readers to match the value with its corresponding colour. Also, the title of the legend is showing the variable name instead of a related name to the chart and might confuse readers on whether the legend is meant for the left chart.\r\nLegend should be shown near to the chart to allow easy matching of the values. Should legend title be required, it should be renamed to a related name to the chart\r\n7\r\nWhile the colour coding used for the chart on “Which country is more pro-vaccine” allows readers to distinctly identify the different categories, it does not depict the relativity of the labels that the finding is on a rating scale.\r\nRevise the colour to show “Strongly agree” and “Agree” to use the same colour of different gradation. Likewise, “Strongly disagree” and “Disagree” will be shown with the same colour of different gradation as well\r\n8\r\nCoordinated use of blue colour for “Strongly agree” across the two charts allows for readers to better infer that the right chart might be showing a related value to the blue bar within the stacked chart of the left chart.\r\nCoordinated use of colours can be adopted where applicable\r\n9\r\nInconsistent x-axis labels across the two charts, where the x-axis labels for the left chart is shown as whole number while the right chart us shown to 1 decimal place\r\nStandardise the number of decimal places across all the axis\r\n10\r\nCountry labels are currently shown in full lowercase and with hyphens in the positions of the spaces. This might not be the best way to depict the country names.\r\nChange the country names into proper case format and replace hyphens with space\r\n2.0 Ways to Improve Current Visualisation\r\nSketch of Proposed Design\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional charts depicting data collected for other fields and the presence of on-demand parameters allow readers to deep dive further into the survey results, as well as to identify if there are any differences between the various segments instead of only comparing at the overall level.\r\nBar charts are kept to show the proportions of respondents within each country that have selected each of the response option. To further improve the ease of comparison, stacked bar charts are adopted that aligns the disagree vs agree.\r\nError bars are added to show the uncertainty associated with survey data, and the range of findings at the various confidence levels.\r\n3.0 Step-by-step Description on Preparation\r\n3.1 Data Source\r\nData used for this visualisation can be downloaded from Imperial College London YouGov Covid 19 Behaviour Tracker Data Hub. While the entire data hosted on Github contains survey results for 30 countries, only the datasets for the following 14 countries were used: Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden and United Kingdom.\r\n3.2 Data Preparation (Excel File and Tableau)\r\nData Inspection of the Data Files for 14 Countries\r\nInspecting the data showed that there are numerous other field columns that were not applicable for the research, as well as data rows that were out of the Jan 2021 timeframe of interest \r\nThe codebook also showed that all the datasets have the same variable fields (i.e. same header)\r\nConcatenating Multiple Datasets in Tableau\r\nLaunch Tableau. Under Connect to a File, click Text File \r\nNavigate to the file directory where the data is saved. Select the one of the country data files (e.g. australia) \r\nRemove the Logical Table of Australia from the Data Source Selection pane \r\nDouble click on New Union under the Files pane on the left \r\nIn the popup “Union” window, drag in the datasets for all 14 countries from the left pane and click OK to merge rows from all datasets into one \r\nFiltering Master Data to Keep Relevant Data\r\nClick on Sheet 1 to add a new worksheet \r\nDrag the dimensions and measures for all the data fields of interest (vac_1, vac2_1, vac2_2, vac2_3, vac2_6, vac_3, gender, age, household_size, household_children, employment_status) as well as country (i.e. Table Name) under the rows \r\nDrag [RecordNo] under Detail of the All Marks Pane to keep the data at the individual respondent record level <br \r\nDrag endtime under Filters and select range of dates, then indicate 1 Jan 2021 12AM as the start date and 31 Jan 2021 11.59PM as the end date to only keep data in Jan 2021 \r\nClick Analysis > View Data. In the popup “View Data” window, click the Export All button to save this filtered set of data as a new file (saved as consolidated_jan21 in this case) \r\nClose the current Tableau session\r\nData Cleaning for Extracted Data in Tableau\r\nLaunch a new Tableau session. Navigate to the directory on computer drive with the file “consolidated_jan2021” and drag the file into Tableau to connect the data\r\nClick on Sheet 1 to add a new worksheet \r\n4.0 Final Data Visualisation Output\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLink to Tableau Dashboard:\r\n5.0 Major Observations\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

However, the current chart only shows the share of the resident labour force by age groups. No data is shown to depict the change in the LFPR, which might confuse the readers on the data being referenced in the analysis.\r\nInclude another additional chart that shows the corresponding LFPR by age bands for 2009 and 2019\r\n2\r\nLead-in paragraph cites the percentages as the sum of broader age bands (e.g. aged 25 to 54 instead of the 5-year age band of 25-29, 30-34 to 50-54) making it difficult for the readers to relate the figures with the chart directly.\r\nAnnotate within the chart the total percentages across the age bands that were being mentioned in the lead-in paragraph so that readers can easily identify how the percentages cited were derived\r\n3\r\nTitle of the existing chart might be confusing as “Resident labour force by age” might be interpreted as the actual number of residents that are in the labour force for each age band but the current unit for the chart is in percent.\r\nRevise the chart title to “Share of Resident Labour Force by Age” to reflect that the figures shown are percentages and total across all age groups will sum to 100%\r\n4\r\nData are being represented in age bands on the x-axis. Using line chart makes it difficult for readers to identify the corresponding points for age group on the x-axis. Also, the use of line chart might mislead the reader to interpret the data as being time-series data. Line charts are not advisable to be used for comparison of categorical data.\r\nRevise the chart to represent each age band as a bar chart (horizontal/ vertical) to clearly show that age is being charted as discrete categorical bands instead of continuous age value\r\n5\r\nWhile having the reference line for the median age is useful for comparing between the 2 years, charting it on the x-axis which is shown in terms of age bands is confusing.\r\nKeep the median age comparison but as a separate chart instead of reference levels\r\nAesthetics\r\nS/N\r\nComments\r\nSuggested Improvement\r\n6\r\nChoice of font, font size and layout is generally clear with the title of the chart at the top left corner of the chart. Labels on x-axis are clearly displayed horizontally.\r\nCan keep to the existing font, font size and layout\r\n7\r\nThe use of colour coding (grey for 2009 and blue for 2019) helps readers to easily distinguish the data between the 2 years. The more recent year of 2019 also stands out since the blue colour used is brighter.\r\nTwo distinct colours can still be used for each year to distinguish between them\r\n8\r\nThere is currently no y-axis and no indication of the data units being shown in the line chart. It might not be clear to the readers what data are being represented by the 2 lines in the chart.\r\nAdd the necessary labelling for the axis to allow readers to clearly identify the data that is being charted\r\n2.0 Ways to Improve Current Visualisation\r\nSketch of Proposed Design\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe usage of bar charts instead of line charts can better represent the data which was grouped into categorical age bands. Presentation of the data in sequential age bands of around 5 years was kept which allows readers to see the differences across the age groups on a more detailed level.\r\nAddition of the chart on the Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR) as well as the net percentages across age bands for the share of Labour Force allows for consistency in the information described in the lead-in paragraph and the charts, where readers can easily identify the source of the data in the visualisation.\r\nHaving the two charts with the corresponding age bands side-by-side allows the readers to easily see how the share and the LFPR has changed for each age band and compare across the age bands.\r\nSeparating the median age from the chart also prevents confusion since the age data was not being shown as a continuous variable.\r\n3.0 Step-by-step Description on Preparation\r\nS/N\r\nInterface\r\nStep\r\nAction\r\n1\r\nExcel Tables\r\nData preparation - Extract relevant data and format into proper structure\r\nPerform the following steps for Table 5 and Table 7:  • Extract data from the Total tab, keeping only column data for 2009 and 2019 as well as row data for the header and the individual age bands (i.e. rows 5, 7 to 18)  • Format the structure to remove all the leading empty rows (i.e. header to start at row 1) and all the empty columns so that the data is in the correct format for importing into Tableau  Save the extracted data into a new excel file with one table on each worksheet tab\r\n2\r\nExcel Tables\r\nData preparation - Format row labels\r\nRemove the extra white spaces in the age labels (e.g. from “15 - 19” to “15 - 19”)\r\n3\r\nData Source\r\nImport data into Tableau\r\n• Under Connect to a File, click Microsoft Excel and select the relevant excel file from the correct directory  • Relate Table 5 and Table 7 using the common variable of Age (Years) \r\n4\r\nSheet 1 (LF_Share)\r\nCreate pyramid chart for Share of Resident Labour Force by Age\r\nDrag T7 Age under Rows, T7 2009 and T7 2019 under Columns \r\n5\r\nSheet 1 (LF_Share)\r\nConvert the measures into percent\r\nUse quick table calculations and convert both T7 2009 and T7 2019 to percent of total (i.e. value shown in the original chart)\r\n6\r\nSheet 1 (LF_Share)\r\nFormat the charts\r\n• Edit the x-axis of the 2009 chart and select “Reversed” to reverse the axis of the chart on the left  • Click on Label and select “Show marks labels” to add the chart labels for both 2009 and 2019 charts  • Format the measures to display them to 1 decimal place by changing the “Numbers” under Default section of the Pane tab to Percentages 1 decimal place  • Right click on the x-axis and select Edit Axis. Fix the range to have a consistent range for both left and right charts  • Colour code the 2 charts into 2 different colours by year using the Colour button under the Marks cart  • Remove the vertical gridlines under Format Lines by changing the “Grid Lines” of the Column tab to None  • Edit the Tooltip under the Marks cart for the label of the % to “% out of Total in [YYYY]” \r\n7\r\nSheet 1 (LF_Share)\r\nFormat the charts – Add the x-axis at the top of the chart\r\n• Drag another T7 2009 (after the current T7 2009) and T7 2019 (after the current T7 2019) under Columns  • Change the chart type back to Bar for all charts  • Use quick table calculations and convert the new T7 2009 and T7 2019 to percent of total  • For each of the new measure added, click on the arrow and select “Dual Axis” to merge the charts of the same measure as one  • Change the colour of the charts for the two new measures to Opacity = 0% under their corresponding Marks cart  • Right click on the x-axis at the top and select “Synchronize Axis”  • “Remove” the bottom x-axis for both charts by selecting Edit Axis then clear the Title text box under Titles and select None for both Major tick marks and Minor tick marks under the Tick Marks tab  • Change the top x-axis to show only the label of “% in June [YYYY]” by selecting Edit Axis then revise the Title text box under Titles and select None for both Major tick marks and Minor tick marks under the Tick Marks tab\r\n8\r\nSheet 1 (LF_Share)\r\nAdd chart title\r\nTitle of the chart was changed to “Share of Resident Labour Force by Age” with the unit of Per cent added below by clicking on the Title to edit\r\n9\r\nData Source\r\nTransform data into required format\r\n• Pivot the columns T5 2009 and T5 2019  • Rename “Pivot Field Names” to “Year”, “Pivot Field Values” to “LFPR”\r\n10\r\nSheet 2 (LFPR)\r\nCreate dumbbell chart for LFPR by Age\r\n• Drag T5 Age under Rows, LFPR under Columns and Year under Colour  • Change the mark type from Automatic to Circle  • Drag another LFPR under Columns and change the mark type to Line  • Remove Year from Colour and drag it to Path \r\n11\r\nSheet 2 (LFPR)\r\nFormat the chart\r\n• Right click on the second pill of LFPR and select “Dual Axis”  • Right click on one of the x-axis and select “Synchronise Axis”  • Swop the order of the two LFPR pills such that the line appears behind the dots  • Rename the bottom x-axis to “% LFPR”  • Hide the top x-axis by right clicking the x-axis and unselecting “Show Header”  • Colour code the dots for the 2 years into the 2 corresponding colours used in the previous chart in Sheet 1  • Increase the size of the dots and the thickness of the line \r\n12\r\nSheet 2 (LFPR)\r\nAdd Chart Title\r\nTitle of the chart was changed to “Resident Labour Force Participation Rate by Age” with the unit of Per cent added below by clicking on the Title to edit\r\n13\r\nSheet 3 (LF_Nett)\r\nCreate new calculated field with recoded age bands\r\nRecode the age into broader age bands using “Create Calculated Fields…” and input the details below \r\n14\r\nSheet 3 (LF_Nett)\r\nCreate table with Share of Resident Labour Force by broader age bands\r\n• Drag Age_Nett under Rows, Measure Names under Columns and Measure Values under Text  • Remove the irrelevant measures under Measure Values to keep only T7 2009 and T7 2019  • Use quick table calculations and convert both T7 2009 and T7 2019 under Measure Values to percent of total\r\n15\r\nSheet 3 (LF_Nett)\r\nFormat the table\r\n• Right click on the header and unselect “Show Header”  • Right click on the header of the rows and select “Hide Field Labels for Rows”  • Click on the arrow for each measure under Measure Values and format to display them to 1 decimal place by changing the “Numbers” under Default section of the Pane tab to Percentages 1 decimal place  • Right click on the table and add table border under the Format Border  • Rearrange the rows in ascending age order by dragging the rows to the correct position\r\n16\r\nDashboard\r\nCreate the Dashboard, Add Title and Format\r\n• Create a new dashboard sheet. Drag LF_Share and LFPR from the Sheets cart into the dashboard sheet to be displayed side by side. Drag LF_Nett under the LF_Share chart  • Select “Show Title” under Dashboard. Title of the dashboard was changed to “Increase in older residents in the labour force from 2009 to 2019”, with the year colour coded  • Add in a text box under the Title to add in the lead-in paragraph\r\n17\r\nDashboard\r\nFormat the Legend\r\n• Rearrange the legend to display it under the LFPR chart  • Right click on each legend and click “Edit Alias” to rename each legend label to “June [YYYY]”  • Click more options on the left of the Legend, select “Arrange items” and Single Row  • Add a Blank to the left of the Legend to right align the Legend relative to the LFPR chart\r\n18\r\nDashboard\r\nAdd in the median ages\r\n• Add in the median ages for 2009 and 2019 with the label of Median Age as separate text boxes under the LFPR_Nett table  • Colour code the median ages by the year\r\n19\r\nData Source\r\nPublish onto Tableau Public\r\nConvert the connection from Live to Extract to allow publishing to Tableau Public \r\n4.0 Final Data Visualisation Output\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLink to Tableau Dashboard: https://public.tableau.com/profile/selenechoong#!/vizhome/ISSS608_DataViz_Makeover_01/Dashboard\r\n5.0 Major Observations\r\nObservation 1:  Between 2009 to 2019, share of the middle-aged residents (aged 25 - 54) among the resident labour force has declined (75.3% in 2009 to 67.4% in 2019), despite the increase in Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR) among these middle-aged residents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObservation 2:  While LFPR remained lower among older residents (aged 55 & over) as compared to the middle-aged residents (aged 25 - 54) in 2019, there was a larger increase in LFPR observed among these older residents between 2009 to 2019, particularly among those aged 60 to 69 with more than 10% point increase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObservation 3:  All age bands experienced a rise in the LFPR between 2009 to 2019, except for residents aged 20 to 24 where LFPR has declined from 63.5% to 61.0%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObservation 4:  Distribution of the resident labour force used to be more right skewed in 2009 (i.e. younger labour force) as compared to 2019, where the distribution of the resident labour force appears to be more symmetric. This is further supported by the increase in median age of the residents in the labour force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
