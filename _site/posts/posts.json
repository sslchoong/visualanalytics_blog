All the data symbols are cluttered and overlapping each other.\r\nTo allow for easier comparison of spatial patterns of armed conflicts, proportional symbol map can be adopted\r\n2\r\nData used in the visualisation for 2020 ends at 31 October 2020 and hence is not complete with event data for November and December missing. Also, data for the Philippines only starts from January 2016 onwards. Readers might be misled by the current time period label of 2015 to 2020, without noticing the presence of the missing data points (i.e. events under-represent for 2020 and missing data for 2015 for the Philippines).\r\nTo download additional data from ACLED for 1 November to 31 December 2020 and provide a complete picture for 2020 events. Only data from 2016 onwards will be used in the visualisation to ensure data is available for the whole timeframe for all the countries shown\r\n3\r\nEach of the data symbol on the map chart is currently showing the spatial information of “Event Id Cnty”, “Latitude” and “Longitude” only in the tooltip. While the map allows readers to identify the country that the event has occurred, readers are not able to easily identify the specific location of the event from the latitude and longitude coordinates. “Event Id Cnty” might also confused readers who are not familiar with the dataset.\r\nInclude the province or district label (depending on the level of mapping used) in tooltip and replace “Event Id Cnty” with the country name instead\r\n4\r\nEach of the event types are being shown as separate line charts and the scale of the y-axis of these charts are not synchronised. Sequence of the charts also changes when filtering between countries. This makes it difficult for the readers to compare across the line charts by event type and by country.\r\nChart all the event types in one chart with each line represented by their corresponding colours used in the map chart\r\n5\r\nWhile there are existing labels for the y-axis of the line charts (Count of Sheet 1), they were not properly labelled to indicate what do the values of the lines represent exactly.\r\nRevise the labelling of the axis to allow readers to clearly identify the data being charted (i.e. count of event occurrence)\r\nAesthetics\r\nS/N\r\nComments\r\nSuggested Improvement\r\n6\r\nWhile tick marks are present for the y-axis of the time-series line charts, they are missing for the x-axis which is also on a continuous scale\r\nInclude tick marks for x-axis of the line charts\r\n7\r\nAll of the data symbols are currently opaque, making it difficult for readers to identify the different points particularly overlapping ones.\r\nIntroduce transparency to the data symbols to allow readers to better view the overlaps (or the extent of overlaps when proportional symbol map is used)\r\n8\r\nInconsistent y-axis labels across the line charts when viewing at the “All” countries level, where the chart for “Violence against civilians” showing the labels as thousands (e.g. 1K, 2K) where other charts were showing in full (e.g. 1000, 2000). Number format can also be improved for those showed in full.\r\nStandardise the labelling format across the axis for all charts and include the comma at 1,000 mark if number format used is to show the number in full\r\n9\r\nDynamic chart title for the map chart is useful to clearly show the readers the relevant country that was selected in the filter and shown in the chart\r\nKeep this dynamic chart title to indicate the filtered parameters\r\nInteractivity\r\nS/N\r\nComments\r\nSuggested Improvement\r\n10\r\nSelecting data points on the line charts do not affect the visualisation within the map chart and vice versa, lacking the interactive filtering to only show the corresponding value on the other charts based on the reader’s selection within the chart\r\nSet the line charts as one of the filter for the dashboard to allow dynamic changes in the map chart based on selection on the line chart\r\n11\r\nWhile there is a country filter to allow readers to select their country of interest, there is currently no parameter to allow filtering by year. For the map chart, all events from 2015 to 2020 are shown and readers cannot see the spatial patterns by years of interest\r\nAdd a filter by year to allow users to select the year of interest\r\n12\r\nUsing tooltips allow readers to obtain more information on each data point that they toggled over, instead of cluttering the information within the visualisation. More information can be included in the tooltip\r\nInclude more detail information such as breakdown by sub-event type within the tooltip\r\n13\r\nSorting is useful to expose patterns but the usage of sorting for the event types (i.e. sequence of line charts) might be confusing to readers since the variable that the sorting is based on might be unclear\r\nIf sorting is used, suggest to include a label on how sorting is done (i.e. variable used for sorting, ascending or descending)\r\n2.0 Ways to Improve Current Visualisation\r\nSketch of Proposed Design\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIncluding dynamic filtering of years in addition to countries allow readers to compare the spatial patterns of armed conflicts in the selected countries over time.\r\nUsing the line chart as filter allows for more dynamic interaction for the readers as they will be shown the corresponding data points on the map for the selected time and event type.\r\nLine charts are kept for depicting the occurrence of armed conflict events over time since line chart is one of the more appropriate chart types for time-series data. Likewise, map chart is kept for representing spatial data.\r\nFurther breakdown of the temporal data by quarters and months will be shown to allow readers to compare for any seasonal changes across the year.\r\n3.0 Step-by-step Description on Preparation\r\n3.1 Data Source\r\nData used for this visualisation can be downloaded from The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), focusing only on the South-east Asia dataset. While some of the South-east Asia countries have data starting from January 2010, only data from January 2016 onwards will be used as data for Philippines starts from 2016. Data is also available till date of download but only data up till 31 December 2020 (the last complete year) will be used.\r\n3.2 Data Preparation\r\nInspection of the Dataset\r\nThe dataset for South-east Asia has multiple fields, where each row represents a unique armed conflict event with multiple columns on different details of the event. The ACLED Codebook is reviewed and a data map is drawn out to show how the different variables are linked. Solid arrows in the data map represents a more granular level of data.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExploring the dataset revealed the following:\r\nSouth-east Asia countries covered include Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. Three countries that were not included were Brunei, Timor-Leste and Singapore\r\nDataset shared by Prof Kam only covers up till 31 October 2020\r\nData for Philippines only start from January 2016, unlike the other countries which have 2015 data\r\nThere is a varying level of certainty of date and location across the events in the dataset\r\nFiltering Relevant Data from ACLED Dataset [Excel Worksheet]\r\nAdditional data was downloaded from ACLED website, which exports data in past 3 years interval regardless of timeframe specified. Comparing the two datasets – (1) shared by Prof Kam and (2) downloaded from ACLED – showed slight discrepancies in the number of data points for the overlapping time period. For consistency, data till 31 October 2020 will be based on Prof Kam’s dataset and data for November to December 2020 will be extracted from the ACLED dataset.\r\nTo extract the relevant time period from the ACLED dataset:\r\nNavigate to the file directory where the downloaded csv dataset is saved and open the file\r\nOn the Home pane, click on the “Sort and Filter” function > Filter \r\nUnder Column E [event_date], click on the dropdown button. Uncheck (Select All) and scroll down to select only 2020 > November and December. Months can be seen by clicking on the (+) button to the left of the year \r\nCopy the filtered data and paste it into another new excel worksheet\r\nSave the file as .csv file under the same file directory as Prof Kam’s dataset and name the file as “Southeast-Asia_Nov-Dec2020”\r\nFor ease of subsequent merging in Tableau, Prof Kam’s dataset will also be converted into csv file format.\r\nConcatenating the Two Datasets in Tableau [Tableau - Data Source]\r\nLaunch Tableau. Under Connect to a File, click Text File \r\nNavigate to the file directory where the csv datasets are saved and double click on the “Southeast-Asia_2010-2020_Oct31” file\r\nRemove the Table of Southeast-Asia_2010-2020_Oct31 from the canvas \r\nDouble click on New Union under the left pane \r\nIn the popup “Union” dialog box, drag in the 2 datasets of Southeast-Asia_2010-2020_Oct31 and Southeast-Asia_Nov-Dec2020 and click Apply.

However, the use of sorting for the chart “% of strongly agreed to vaccination” makes it easier for readers to view the relative results across the countries.\r\nAlign the country order such that the values for each country are shown on the same row. Countries can be sorted in decreasing % of respondents who selected strongly agreed\r\n2\r\nThe charts are showing the % of survey respondents who selected the respective response values. As the survey only polled a subset of the citizens within each country (i.e. sample) instead of all citizens (i.e. population), there would be some form of uncertainty associated with the values shown. However, the existing chart does not depict any uncertainty and readers might interpret the chart as showing the precise representation of the country’s true acceptance towards the vaccine.\r\nExplore using statistical values to reflect the uncertainty associated with the survey results\r\n3\r\nThe current chart title does not clearly describe the question being asked to capture the findings shown, which is only covering willingness to get the vaccine if available this week. Research also mainly utilised the survey data from interviews conducted in January 2021, but this timeframe was not shown in the data visualisation.\r\nRevise the chart title to better represent the question asked as well as to reflect the timeframe of January 2021 within the data visualisation\r\n4\r\nValue labels for the left chart were kept to the original data labels which only indicated the textual label for rating 1 and rating 5 and keeping ratings 2 to 4 as the numeric label only. This might not be intuitive to the readers on what each number represents.\r\nRecode the values to use textual labels instead (i.e. 1 as “Strongly agree”, 2 as “Agree”, 3 as “Neutral”, 4 as “Disagree” and 5 as “Strongly disagree”)\r\n5\r\nScale of the x-axis of the two charts are not synchronised, causing the bars of the right chart to appear longer than the same value on the left chart. This might be misleading to the readers.\r\nSynchronise the axis for all charts, particularly those that are side by side so that the scales of the charts are aligned\r\nAesthetics\r\nS/N\r\nComments\r\nSuggested Improvement\r\n6\r\nCurrent position of the legend makes it difficult for the readers to match the value with its corresponding colour. Also, the title of the legend is showing the variable name instead of a related name to the chart and might confuse readers on whether the legend is meant for the left chart.\r\nLegend should be shown near to the chart to allow easy matching of the values. Should legend title be required, it should be renamed to a related name to the chart\r\n7\r\nWhile the colour coding used for the chart on “Which country is more pro-vaccine” allows readers to distinctly identify the different categories, it does not depict the relativity of the labels that the finding is on a rating scale.\r\nRevise the colour to show “Strongly agree” and “Agree” to use the same colour of different gradation. Likewise, “Strongly disagree” and “Disagree” will be shown with the same colour of different gradation as well\r\n8\r\nCoordinated use of blue colour for “Strongly agree” across the two charts allows for readers to better infer that the right chart might be showing a related value to the blue bar within the stacked chart of the left chart.\r\nCoordinated use of colours can be adopted where applicable\r\n9\r\nInconsistent x-axis labels across the two charts, where the x-axis labels for the left chart is shown as whole number while the right chart us shown to 1 decimal place\r\nStandardise the number of decimal places across all the axis\r\n10\r\nCountry labels are currently shown in full lowercase and with hyphens in the positions of the spaces. This might not be the best way to depict the country names.\r\nChange the country names into proper case format and replace hyphens with space\r\n2.0 Ways to Improve Current Visualisation\r\nSketch of Proposed Design\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional charts depicting data collected for other fields and the presence of on-demand parameters allow readers to deep dive further into the survey results, as well as to identify if there are any differences between the various segments instead of only comparing at the overall level.\r\nBar charts are kept to show the proportions of respondents within each country that have selected each of the response option. To further improve the ease of comparison, stacked bar charts are adopted that aligns the disagree vs agree.\r\nError bars are added to show the uncertainty associated with survey data, and the range of findings at the various confidence levels.\r\n3.0 Step-by-step Description on Preparation\r\n3.1 Data Source\r\nData used for this visualisation can be downloaded from Imperial College London YouGov Covid 19 Behaviour Tracker Data Hub. While the entire data hosted on Github contains survey results for 30 countries, only the datasets for the following 14 countries were used: Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden and United Kingdom.\r\n3.2 Data Preparation\r\nData Inspection of the Data Files for 14 Countries\r\nInspecting the data showed that there are numerous other field columns that were not applicable for the research, as well as data rows that were out of the Jan 2021 timeframe of interest \r\nThe codebook showed that all the datasets have the same variable fields (i.e. same header)\r\nThere were some observed inconsistencies in the coding for some variables (e.g. Employment Status)\r\nConcatenating Multiple Datasets in Tableau\r\nLaunch Tableau.

Higher proportion of older respondents agreed that they will definitely get the vaccine if made available, as compared to younger respondents. This applies to both the availability of this week and a year from now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObservation 3:  While Japan has the highest proportion of respondents who indicated that they are worried about getting Covid-19 among the 14 countries, it has the lowest proportion of respondents who agreed they they get the Covid-19 vaccination if made available to them this week or even a year from now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObservation 4:  Higher willingness of UK and Denmark respondents to receive the Covid-19 vaccination might have been contributed by their perceptions of the vaccination. We observed a similarly higher proportion of respondents from these countries who believed that their government health authorities will provide them with an effective Covid-19 vaccine, as well as a lower proportion of them who are worried about the potential side effects of the vaccine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

However, the current chart only shows the share of the resident labour force by age groups. No data is shown to depict the change in the LFPR, which might confuse the readers on the data being referenced in the analysis.\r\nInclude another additional chart that shows the corresponding LFPR by age bands for 2009 and 2019\r\n2\r\nLead-in paragraph cites the percentages as the sum of broader age bands (e.g. aged 25 to 54 instead of the 5-year age band of 25-29, 30-34 to 50-54) making it difficult for the readers to relate the figures with the chart directly.\r\nAnnotate within the chart the total percentages across the age bands that were being mentioned in the lead-in paragraph so that readers can easily identify how the percentages cited were derived\r\n3\r\nTitle of the existing chart might be confusing as “Resident labour force by age” might be interpreted as the actual number of residents that are in the labour force for each age band but the current unit for the chart is in percent.\r\nRevise the chart title to “Share of Resident Labour Force by Age” to reflect that the figures shown are percentages and total across all age groups will sum to 100%\r\n4\r\nData are being represented in age bands on the x-axis. Using line chart makes it difficult for readers to identify the corresponding points for age group on the x-axis. Also, the use of line chart might mislead the reader to interpret the data as being time-series data. Line charts are not advisable to be used for comparison of categorical data.\r\nRevise the chart to represent each age band as a bar chart (horizontal/ vertical) to clearly show that age is being charted as discrete categorical bands instead of continuous age value\r\n5\r\nWhile having the reference line for the median age is useful for comparing between the 2 years, charting it on the x-axis which is shown in terms of age bands is confusing.\r\nKeep the median age comparison but as a separate chart instead of reference levels\r\nAesthetics\r\nS/N\r\nComments\r\nSuggested Improvement\r\n6\r\nChoice of font, font size and layout is generally clear with the title of the chart at the top left corner of the chart. Labels on x-axis are clearly displayed horizontally.\r\nCan keep to the existing font, font size and layout\r\n7\r\nThe use of colour coding (grey for 2009 and blue for 2019) helps readers to easily distinguish the data between the 2 years. The more recent year of 2019 also stands out since the blue colour used is brighter.\r\nTwo distinct colours can still be used for each year to distinguish between them\r\n8\r\nThere is currently no y-axis and no indication of the data units being shown in the line chart. It might not be clear to the readers what data are being represented by the 2 lines in the chart.\r\nAdd the necessary labelling for the axis to allow readers to clearly identify the data that is being charted\r\n2.0 Ways to Improve Current Visualisation\r\nSketch of Proposed Design\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe usage of bar charts instead of line charts can better represent the data which was grouped into categorical age bands. Presentation of the data in sequential age bands of around 5 years was kept which allows readers to see the differences across the age groups on a more detailed level.\r\nAddition of the chart on the Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR) as well as the net percentages across age bands for the share of Labour Force allows for consistency in the information described in the lead-in paragraph and the charts, where readers can easily identify the source of the data in the visualisation.\r\nHaving the two charts with the corresponding age bands side-by-side allows the readers to easily see how the share and the LFPR has changed for each age band and compare across the age bands.\r\nSeparating the median age from the chart also prevents confusion since the age data was not being shown as a continuous variable.\r\n3.0 Step-by-step Description on Preparation\r\nS/N\r\nInterface\r\nStep\r\nAction\r\n1\r\nExcel Tables\r\nData preparation - Extract relevant data and format into proper structure\r\nPerform the following steps for Table 5 and Table 7:  • Extract data from the Total tab, keeping only column data for 2009 and 2019 as well as row data for the header and the individual age bands (i.e. rows 5, 7 to 18)  • Format the structure to remove all the leading empty rows (i.e. header to start at row 1) and all the empty columns so that the data is in the correct format for importing into Tableau  Save the extracted data into a new excel file with one table on each worksheet tab\r\n2\r\nExcel Tables\r\nData preparation - Format row labels\r\nRemove the extra white spaces in the age labels (e.g. from “15 - 19” to “15 - 19”)\r\n3\r\nData Source\r\nImport data into Tableau\r\n• Under Connect to a File, click Microsoft Excel and select the relevant excel file from the correct directory  • Relate Table 5 and Table 7 using the common variable of Age (Years) \r\n4\r\nSheet 1 (LF_Share)\r\nCreate pyramid chart for Share of Resident Labour Force by Age\r\nDrag T7 Age under Rows, T7 2009 and T7 2019 under Columns \r\n5\r\nSheet 1 (LF_Share)\r\nConvert the measures into percent\r\nUse quick table calculations and convert both T7 2009 and T7 2019 to percent of total (i.e. value shown in the original chart)\r\n6\r\nSheet 1 (LF_Share)\r\nFormat the charts\r\n• Edit the x-axis of the 2009 chart and select “Reversed” to reverse the axis of the chart on the left  • Click on Label and select “Show marks labels” to add the chart labels for both 2009 and 2019 charts  • Format the measures to display them to 1 decimal place by changing the “Numbers” under Default section of the Pane tab to Percentages 1 decimal place  • Right click on the x-axis and select Edit Axis.

This is further supported by the increase in median age of the residents in the labour force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
