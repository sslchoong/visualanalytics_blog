title: "DataViz Makeover 2"
description: |
  A makeover of a data visualisation on the willingness of the public towards Covid-19 vaccination. Data was obtained from Imperial College London YouGov Covid 19 Behaviour Tracker Data Hub hosted at Github (https://github.com/YouGov-Data/covid-19-tracker), with the focus on survey data collected in January 2021.

### Clarity

| 1 | Both charts are showing the findings from the same question, but charts are titled differently and the order of the countries on the y-axis are not synchronised. Readers might be confused that the charts are showing findings from 2 separate questions, and it is difficult for readers to match the corresponding country bars between the two charts. However, the use of sorting for the chart “% of strongly agreed to vaccination” makes it easier for readers to view the relative results across the countries. | Include the values of % strongly agreed as part of the left chart instead of a separate chart, and aligning the country order such that the values for each country are shown on the same row. Countries can be sorted in decreasing % of respondents who selected strongly agreed |
| 2 | The charts are showing the % of survey respondents who selected the respective response values. As the survey only polled a subset of the citizens within each country (i.e. sample) instead of all citizens (i.e. population), there would be some form of uncertainty associated with the values shown. However, the existing chart does not depict any uncertainty and readers might interpret the chart as showing the precise representation of the country’s true acceptance towards the vaccine. | Explore using statistical values to reflect the uncertainty associated with the survey results |
| 3 | Value labels for the left chart were kept to the original data labels which only indicated the textual label for rating 1 and rating 5 and keeping ratings 2 to 4 as the numeric label only. This might not be intuitive to the readers on what each number represents. | Recode the values to use textual labels instead (i.e. 1 as “Strongly agree”, 2 as “Agree”, 3 as “Neutral”, 4 as “Disagree” and 5 as “Strongly disagree”) |
| 4 | The current visualisation is only showing the overall finding for each country for a single question on the likelihood to get a Covid-19 vaccine if made available this week, which does not show a comprehensive picture with regard to each country’s willingness on Covid-19 vaccination as well as their segment differences. | Include additional findings from other questions related to the willingness of the public on Covid-19 vaccination for each country. Filters can be including to allow dynamic segmentation of the data visualisation to understand the willingness by different demographic fields |
| 5 | Research mainly utilised the survey data from interviews conducted in January 2021 but this timeframe was not shown in the data visualisation to provide readers more context on the scope. | Include the timeframe of January 2021 within the data visualisation |

### Aesthetics

| 6 | Current position of the legend makes it difficult for the readers to match the value with its corresponding colour. Also, the title of the legend is showing the variable name instead of a related name to the chart and might confuse readers on whether the legend is meant for the left chart. | Legend should be shown near to the chart to allow easy matching of the values. Should legend title be required, it should be renamed to a related name to the chart |
| 7 | While the colour coding used for the chart on “Which country is more pro-vaccine” allows readers to distinctly identify the different categories, it does not depict the relativity of the labels that the finding is on a rating scale. | Revise the colour to show “Strongly agree” and “Agree” to use the same colour of different gradation. Likewise, “Strongly disagree” and “Disagree” will be shown with the same colour of different gradation as well |
| 8 | Coordinated use of blue colour for “Strongly agree” across the two charts allows for readers to better infer that the right chart might be showing a related value to the blue bar within the stacked chart of the left chart. | Coordinated use of colours can be adopted where applicable |
| 9 | Scale of the x-axis of the two charts are not synchronised, causing the bars of the right chart to appear longer than the same value on the left chart. This might cause some visual confusion to the readers before they notice the differences in the axis scales. | Synchronise the axis for all charts, particularly those that are side by side so that the scales of the charts are aligned |
| 10 | Country labels are currently shown in full lowercase and with hyphens in the positions of the spaces. This might not be the best way to depict the country names. | Change the country names into proper case format and replace hyphens with space |
