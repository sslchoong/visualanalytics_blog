# 1.0  Critiques of Existing Visualisation with Suggested Improvements

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("images/Fig1_ExistingViz.png")
```

### Clarity

|S/N| Comments | Suggested Improvement |
|:-:| :------------------------------- | :------------------------------- |
| 1 | While the current map chart provides detailed information where each point represents each event, it is difficult for readers to compare the spatial data across the regions or countries especially when viewing at the “All” countries level. All the data symbols are cluttered and overlapping each other. | To allow for easier comparison of spatial patterns of armed conflicts, proportional symbol map can be adopted |
| 2 | Data used in the visualisation for 2020 ends at 31 October 2020 and hence is not complete with event data for November and December missing. Also, data for the Philippines only starts from January 2016 onwards. Readers might be misled by the current time period label of 2015 to 2020, without noticing the presence of the missing data points (i.e. events under-represent for 2020 and missing data for 2015 for the Philippines). | To download additional data from ACLED for 1 November to 31 December 2020 and provide a complete picture for 2020 events. Only data from 2016 onwards will be used in the visualisation to ensure data is available for the whole timeframe for all the countries shown |
| 3 | Each of the data symbol on the map chart is currently showing the spatial information of “Event Id Cnty”, “Latitude” and “Longitude” only in the tooltip. While the map allows readers to identify the country that the event has occurred, readers are not able to easily identify the specific location of the event from the latitude and longitude coordinates. “Event Id Cnty” might also confused readers who are not familiar with the dataset. | Include the province or district label (depending on the level of mapping used) in tooltip and replace “Event Id Cnty” with the country name instead |
| 4 | Each of the event types are being shown as separate line charts and the scale of the y-axis of these charts are not synchronised. Sequence of the charts also changes when filtering between countries. This makes it difficult for the readers to compare across the line charts by event type and by country. | Chart all the event types in one chart with each line represented by their corresponding colours used in the map chart |
| 5 | While there are existing labels for the y-axis of the line charts (Count of Sheet 1), they were not properly labelled to indicate what do the values of the lines represent exactly. | Revise the labelling of the axis to allow readers to clearly identify the data being charted (i.e. count of event occurrence) |

### Aesthetics

|S/N| Comments | Suggested Improvement |
|:-:| :------------------------------- | :------------------------------- |
| 6 | While tick marks are present for the y-axis of the time-series line charts, they are missing for the x-axis which is also on a continuous scale | Include tick marks for x-axis of the line charts |
| 7 | All of the data symbols are currently opaque, making it difficult for readers to identify the different points particularly overlapping ones. | Introduce transparency to the data symbols to allow readers to better view the overlaps (or the extent of overlaps when proportional symbol map is used) |
| 8 | Inconsistent y-axis labels across the line charts when viewing at the “All” countries level, where the chart for “Violence against civilians” showing the labels as thousands (e.g. 1K, 2K) where other charts were showing in full (e.g. 1000, 2000). Number format can also be improved for those showed in full. | Standardise the labelling format across the axis for all charts and include the comma at 1,000 mark if number format used is to show the number in full |
| 9 | Dynamic chart title for the map chart is useful to clearly show the readers the relevant country that was selected in the filter and shown in the chart | Keep this dynamic chart title to indicate the filtered parameters |

### Interactivity

|S/N| Comments | Suggested Improvement |
|:-:| :------------------------------- | :------------------------------- |
| 10 | Selecting data points on the line charts do not affect the visualisation within the map chart and vice versa, lacking the interactive filtering to only show the corresponding value on the other charts based on the reader’s selection within the chart | Set the line charts as one of the filter for the dashboard to allow dynamic changes in the map chart based on selection on the line chart |
| 11 | While there is a country filter to allow readers to select their country of interest, there is currently no parameter to allow filtering by year. For the map chart, all events from 2015 to 2020 are shown and readers cannot see the spatial patterns by years of interest | Add a filter by year to allow users to select the year of interest |
| 12 | Using tooltips allow readers to obtain more information on each data point that they toggled over, instead of cluttering the information within the visualisation. More information can be included in the tooltip | Include more detail information such as breakdown by sub-event type within the tooltip |
| 13 | Sorting is useful to expose patterns but the usage of sorting for the event types (i.e. sequence of line charts) might be confusing to readers since the variable that the sorting is based on might be unclear | If sorting is used, suggest to include a label on how sorting is done (i.e. variable used for sorting, ascending or descending) |


# 2.0  Ways to Improve Current Visualisation

### Sketch of Proposed Design

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("images/Fig2_Sketch.jpg")
```

- Including dynamic filtering of years in addition to countries allow readers to compare the spatial patterns of armed conflicts in the selected countries over time.
- Using the line chart as filter allows for more dynamic interaction for the readers as they will be shown the corresponding data points on the map for the selected time and event type.
- Line charts are kept for depicting the occurrence of armed conflict events over time since line chart is one of the more appropriate chart types for time-series data. Likewise, map chart is kept for representing spatial data.
- Further breakdown of the temporal data by quarters and months will be shown to allow readers to compare for any seasonal changes across the year.

# 3.0  Step-by-step Description on Preparation

## 3.1 Data Source

Data used for this visualisation can be downloaded from [The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED)](https://acleddata.com/data-export-tool/), focusing only on the South-east Asia dataset. While some of the South-east Asia countries have data starting from January 2010, only data from January 2016 onwards will be used as data for Philippines starts from 2016. Data is also available till date of download but only data up till 31 December 2020 (the last complete year) will be used.

## 3.2 Data Preparation

### Inspection of the Dataset

The dataset for South-east Asia has multiple fields, where each row represents a unique armed conflict event with multiple columns on different details of the event. The ACLED Codebook is reviewed and a data map is drawn out to show how the different variables are linked. Solid arrows in the data map represents a more granular level of data.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("images/Fig3_DataMap.png")
```

Exploring the dataset revealed the following:

-	South-east Asia countries covered include Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. Three countries that were not included were Brunei, Timor-Leste and Singapore
- Dataset shared by Prof Kam only covers up till 31 October 2020
-	Data for Philippines only start from January 2016, unlike the other countries which have 2015 data
- There is a varying level of certainty of date and location across the events in the dataset

### Filtering Relevant Data from ACLED Dataset [Excel Worksheet]

Additional data was downloaded from ACLED website, which exports data in past 3 years interval regardless of timeframe specified. Comparing the two datasets – (1) shared by Prof Kam and (2) downloaded from ACLED – showed slight discrepancies in the number of data points for the overlapping time period. For consistency, data till 31 October 2020 will be based on Prof Kam’s dataset and data for November to December 2020 will be extracted from the ACLED dataset.

To extract the relevant time period from the ACLED dataset:

- Navigate to the file directory where the downloaded csv dataset is saved and open the file
- On the Home pane, click on the “Sort and Filter” function > Filter <br>
![](images/0.1.png){width=100%}
- Under Column E [event_date], click on the dropdown button. Uncheck (Select All) and scroll down to select only 2020 > November and December. Months can be seen by clicking on the (+) button to the left of the year <br>
![](images/0.2.png){width=50%}
- Copy the filtered data and paste it into another new excel worksheet
- Save the file as .csv file under the same file directory as Prof Kam’s dataset and name the file as “Southeast-Asia_Nov-Dec2020”

For ease of subsequent merging in Tableau, Prof Kam’s dataset will also be converted into csv file format.

### Concatenating the Two Datasets in Tableau [Tableau - Data Source]

- Launch Tableau. Under Connect to a File, click Text File <br>
![](images/1.1.png){width=30%}
- Navigate to the file directory where the csv datasets are saved and double click on the “Southeast-Asia_2010-2020_Oct31” file
